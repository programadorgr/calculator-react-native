This is a [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# ðŸ“„ Brief description of the app

This sleek calculator app makes math easy with a clean, minimalist interface.
Supports standard arithmetic of a traditional calculator. The intuitive interface and uncluttered design makes calculation a breeze. 
Developed based on an example given in freecodecamp. Entirely developed with react native ðŸ“±.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## ðŸ”µ Step 1: Install

Setup the environment and the dependencies

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

## ðŸ”µ Step 2: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## ðŸ”µ Step 3: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## ðŸš€ Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run your React Native App. :partying_face:
